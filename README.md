# OtterShit
This will contain some otter shit

This is the readme about my life. 
There were two people, male and female, that exchanged bodily fluids. 
9 months later, there I was! 
28 years later I'm in the possession of a bachelor degree in Biology which granted me access to the great university of Groningen at which I am studying Marine Biology now. 
What a life!
